As a Software Engineer Co-op at [Wave](https://waveapps.com/), a medium-sized company providing invoicing and accounting software for small businesses, I set out to achieve several goals to become a better engineer and contribute to the company's growth. This report outlines my goals and reflections during the work term.

#### Goals and learning outcomes

##### Evaluate Developer Pain Points

For my first goal, I aimed to evaluate developer pain points on the frontend within the company. My action plan involved speaking directly with developers about their challenges and time sinks, as well as gathering survey feedback about improvement opportunities as seen by the developers themselves. The measure of success for this goal was better inform initiatives from the data I collected.

Upon reflection, I found that while a developer survey was conducted, it proved difficult to extract actionable items from the results due to the broad nature of the questions. This experience highlighted a valuable lesson in survey design and data collection. Moving forward, I believe a more targeted survey, perhaps specifically aimed at frontend developers, would be warranted to gather more precise and actionable insights. This approach could yield more specific pain points and improvement opportunities, allowing for more effective initiative planning.

##### Become a Better Public Speaker

My second goal focused on improving my public speaking skills. To achieve this, I planned to present topics at the JavaScript Working Group, engage in debates with coworkers, and, as an optional stretch goal, present an idea at a Wave Tech Talk. I measured my success by assessing my confidence in speaking, aiming for less stuttering and fewer filler words, as well as my ability to successfully convey ideas and sway opinions.

I'm happy to say that this learning goal was a resounding success. Not only did I complete all aspects of my action plan, including the optional presentation at a Wave Tech Talk, but I also noticed a significant improvement in my confidence and articulation. Throughout the work term, my ability to convey ideas clearly and engage in productive debates with colleagues markedly improved. This enhancement in communication skills has not only boosted my personal confidence but has also contributed to more effective team interactions and discussions.

##### Pitch and Lead Initiatives

For my third goal, I set out to pitch and lead initiatives within the company. My action plan involved identifying solutions to real problems faced by developers, pitching these ideas to team members and the JavaScript Working Group (JSWG), prioritizing the initiatives, and implementing them. I measured my success through positive feedback from developers, such as supportive Slack messages and reactions.

Looking back, I think I did well in thinking of and executing on initiatives. The projects I worked on, such as the migration from Webpack to Vite, were well-received by developers, as evidenced by the positive feedback received through various channels. While there is always room for improvement, particularly in areas such as project prioritization and execution efficiency, the overall response suggests that my contributions have been valuable to both the team and the company. This experience has been instrumental in developing my project management and leadership skills, providing a solid foundation for future growth in these areas.

#### Conclusion

This work term at Wave has been incredibly valuable for my professional growth, and I really mean it. I've started to grow from a passive completer-of-tasks to a more active contributor that participates in discussions and takes on initiatives. While some areas, such as documenting and communicating a project timeline, still have room for improvement, my time at Wave has been an incredible learning opportunity and has set a strong foundation for my career. The skills gained during this co-op term will undoubtedly prove beneficial as I continue to grow as a software engineer.
