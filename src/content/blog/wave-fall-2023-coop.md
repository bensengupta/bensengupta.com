This work term report covers my goals & reflections on my second co-op work term at Wave Financial. See Co-op Work Term Report 1 – Wave for my first work term.
During my fall co-op term at Wave Financial, I set out to achieve three distinct learning goals aimed at broadening my global understanding and becoming a better problem solver. Each goal focused on specific aspects, including gaining experience in backend development, effectively prioritizing impactful actions, and becoming proficient at reading and understanding unfamiliar code.

#### Goals and learning outcomes

##### Gaining Backend Expertise

My first goal centered on developing a comprehensive understanding of backend development and its implications on customer experiences. To achieve this, I actively engaged in backend tasks by picking up relevant tickets and paired with colleagues to understand underlying concepts. Success was measured through milestones, including ticket completion, PR reviews, participation in Knowledge Share discussions, and contributions beyond tickets, such as process improvements. 

I successfully completed several backend tasks, but after some time I discovered that I have a strong preference for frontend-related work. I attribute this preference to several factors:

1.	IDE support: The frontend project was relatively simple in nature and as a result, editor extensions typically worked out of the box. In contrast, the backend was highly containerized making it significantly more difficult to make editor extensions work. Convenient editor shortcuts like ‘Jump to definition’ or ‘Rename variable’ were not possible, and linting errors/warnings are not shown.
2.	Debugging: I found troubleshooting strange behavior visible on the web app was easier while working on the frontend than working on the backend, due primarily to faster iteration speed and better logging on the frontend.
3.	Complexity: The backend developer environment utilized containers running dozens of services all running at once, and at times it was more difficult to trace a request across different repositories and services.

As a result, towards the end of my time at Wave, I started picking up more frontend work until I eventually joined the Frontend platform team where I shipped changes that aimed to improve developer experience for the frontend codebase. 

##### Prioritizing Impactful Actions

My second learning goal aimed at cultivating critical and creative thinking skills by effectively prioritizing actions that hold significant importance for the company. My measure of success for this was to receive kudos for high impact tasks.

I believe the skill of prioritization comes with time and experience. During my time on the Frontend platform team, I set a high priority for ensuring developers could ship code without interruptions. When end-to-end tests started failing due to a transient condition, I made it my priority to fix them to make the process smoother. On some occasions, I also helped during incidents to roll back changes and identify the root cause of bugs. All things considered, I think I have lots of room to grow in terms of prioritizing issues, but I have made some meaningful progress towards this goal.

##### Proficiency in Unfamiliar Code

The third learning goal emphasized developing a global understanding through proficiency in reading and comprehending unfamiliar code. This involved exploring code from other teams, understanding differences in coding styles, and being able to troubleshoot issues across unfamiliar codebases. Success was gauged by the ability to quickly learn unfamiliar code and make changes independently.
I love solving challenging problems. While in my fall co-op term, I expanded the range of programming languages and codebases I was familiar with. On one occasion, I had the opportunity to trace a query through 5 different projects to simplify said query.

#### Conclusion

My co-op term was a valuable journey of skill development, with achievements and insights gained in backend development, prioritization of impactful actions, and proficiency in understanding unfamiliar code. These experiences have not only contributed to my personal growth but have also provided valuable contributions to the projects at Wave.

Wave was truly awesome. Special thank you to Edan, Dylan, Natasha, Amanda, Wilson, Luis, Patrick, Amber, Vansh, and all the great folks from the ARCS and Frontend platform teams for making this time of my life incredible! ❤️
