Completing my fourth co-op term at [Wave](https://www.waveapps.com/), a money management company for small businesses, provided me with invaluable experience in both technical skills and professional development. During this work term, I deliberately focused on backend engineering aspects, improving my communication, and planning for my post-graduation career path. These focus areas allowed me to gain practical experience while aligning with my long-term career goals in software engineering.

### Goals and learning outcomes

#### Deepen understanding of backend concerns

I have a strong understanding of the frontend tech stack at Wave, but I lack experience in building backend systems.
Working at Wave presented me with a lot of opportunities to dig deep into backend tech that I'd previously only encountered in side-projects. I intentionally sought out tickets involving unfamiliar technologies, which led me to work with Kafka, Django, and Kubernetes in a production environment. The experience of designing and implementing solutions for real business problems using these tools was very valuable.

Through pairing sessions and feedback from senior engineers, I gained insight into system design considerations that aren't covered in academic courses. For instance, I learned some of the benefits of Kafka consumers over standard SQS queues, and how to design resilient microservices that degrade gracefully under failure conditions. While I did learn a lot about backend systems, I recognize that I still have substantial room for growth in observability practices and implementing comprehensive fault-tolerance strategies. The complexity of ensuring system reliability at scale has given me a new appreciation for the importance of monitoring, logging, and defensive programming techniques.

#### Strengthen communication skills

Throughout my time working at Wave, I have found that good communication is a hallmark of a valuable engineer. I set out to improve my communication skills this work term.

I successfully delivered a presentation at one of Wave's monthly company demos, showcasing an internal tool for risk analysis. This experience taught me how to distill complex technical concepts into clear explanations for diverse audiences including product managers, designers, and executives.

I developed better instincts about when to reach out for help versus when to pursue independent research. Early in my term, I often spent too long stuck on problems before seeking assistance. I was afraid of being perceived as unresourceful and didn't want to waste another engineer's time.

I have changed my mind on this significantly. I read a short blog post about communication, [drop that meet link](https://sunilpai.dev/posts/drop-that-meet-link/), and it really struck a chord with me. Written communication still has its place, but there is nothing like a meeting to convey information and align quickly.

This approach optimized my productivity while respecting others' time. Regular check-ins with my manager provided valuable feedback that allowed me to continuously refine my communication approach throughout the term.

#### Prepare for post-coop position

With graduation on the horizon, I approached this co-op term with a focus on aligning my goals with those of a Software Engineer II. I created a comprehensive career development document that mapped out the skills and experiences needed to advance to a SE II position at Wave or similar companies.

Throughout the term, I systematically tracked my progress against these criteria, identifying areas where I excelled (e.g., code reviews and technical problem solving) and areas requiring additional focus (e.g., system design, discovery). This structured approach to career planning helped me maximize my learning during the co-op. In my regular meetings with my manager, we discussed my progress and recalibrated my goals based on feedback. This forward-looking approach not only enhanced my co-op experience but also positioned me well for post-graduation opportunities by giving me clear development objectives and a realistic understanding of industry expectations.

### Conclusion

My fourth co-op term at Wave provided the ideal blend of technical challenge and professional growth. The hands-on experience with production backend systems, opportunities to refine my communication skills, and structured approach to career planning have significantly accelerated my development as a software engineer.

As I prepare to transition from student to full-time professional, I'm confident that the skills and perspectives gained during this work term have positioned me for success in the tech industry.
